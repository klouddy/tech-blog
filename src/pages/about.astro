		Hi, I'm Jake Romero, a full stack developer with over 15 years of experience in software development. My background is rooted in building robust backend services, especially with Java, but I enjoy working across the entire stack to deliver complete solutions. I have a passion for solving complex problems and creating innovative software that makes a real difference. Lately, I've been especially excited about the potential of AI and how it can enhance our daily lives.

		This blog is a space where I share what I'm learning and exploring in technology. Whether it's new programming techniques, insights into backend architecture, or experiments with AI, my goal is to document the journey and hopefully inspire or help others along the way.
